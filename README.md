# Jobs in Data

This small project is a case study that aims to analyze and visualize the data concerning different professions associated with data. I became personally interested in this matter because I am pursuing a career in this field. I aimed to showcase trends in experience, salary and locations using real-world data. In this project, I will ask and answer several important questions. My findings will be showcased using Power BI.
