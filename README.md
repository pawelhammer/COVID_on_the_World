# Jobs in Data

This project aims to analyze and visualize the data concerning different professions associated with data. I became personally interested in this matter because of my dream of working in this field. I aimed to showcase trends in experience, salary and backgrounds using real-world data I found on Kaggle. I came up with this project, where I will answer some of the most interesting questions that I have. My findings will be showcased using PowerBI.

Stay tuned!
