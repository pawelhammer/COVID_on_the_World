# COVID_on_the_World

This project will aim to analyze and visualize the data concerning the effect of the COVID pandemic on different countries in areas such as education, and transportation. Furthermore, in the used dataset there are other pieces of information, such as temperature.
It's a project made for showcasing possible links between these seemingly unrelated data. 

Stay tuned!
