# Jobs in Data

This small project is a case study that aims to analyze and visualize the data concerning different professions associated with data. I became personally interested in this matter because I am pursuing a career in this field. I aimed to showcase trends in experience, salary and locations using real-world data. In this project, I will ask and answer several important questions. My findings will be showcased using Power BI.

## Tech stack:
- PostgreSQL

### Questions

The things I wanted to know were:
- How many workers from each seniority are there and which specialization has the most employees?
- According to the results from the previous question, what was the percentage of each seniority in the top 3 specializations?
- How many workers earn above and below the average for their respective field?
- What is the difference between average earnings and salary of employees in the database?
- The countries are not enough: are there any workers that are employed in a company that is located on a different continent than country of their residence?
